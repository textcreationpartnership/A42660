            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But by Death I underſtand, as well Chriſt's death as our own. The death of Chriſt and his ſuffering is the ſumm of Chriſtianity:
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.2.</note> thence the Apoſtle judged, that among his Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians he would <hi>know nothing ſave Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:41602:3"/>crucified</hi> and dead. By Chriſt's death is made an expiation of our ſins, a deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Satan's power, a confirmation of the new covenant, and a leſſening of thoſe terrours that are wont to accompany our death: The meditation of the death of Chriſt therefore ought never to depart out of our memory. But neither in any time of our life let us forget our own death: As death awaits us every day, ſo let us on the other hand expect it every day.

Hence are thoſe various temptations, wherewith as with battering Rams he aſſaults our heart in ſickneſs and in the agony of death: hence thoſe fiery darts, which he caſts at us with all his ſtrength: hence that horrour and anxiety which we feel when we approch the gates of death.

            <p>Wherefore ſeeing ſome while ago I have endeavoured by an explication of the Hiſtory of the paſſion and death of Chriſt to inſtill into the minds of the Godly the meditation of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> death; I thought it would be worth the while, if to ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I ſhould alſo propound the meditation of <hi>our</hi> death: for which end I writ theſe divine conſolations to be oppoſed to the terrors of death and to temptations in the agony of death for my own private uſe only; for I carry about a ſickly body, a brittle veſſel, and beſides, death not long ago made a lamentable deſtruction in my own houſe, and there are many reaſons for which I fear my own life will not be long; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would betimes prepare and fence my mind for this laſt agony; and being
<pb facs="tcp:41602:4"/>incompaſſed with ſo many domeſtick evils I beſtow'd ſome days on the pious medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this little book: which meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of mine ſeeing perhaps they may be uſeful to others alſo, I was not unwilling to publiſh them. But this I would adviſe in the beginning of this Treatiſe, that I writ not for ſecure, impenitent and hard hearts, but for contrite, broken and bleeding conſciences: Exhortations to true godlineſs belong to another place; this diſcourſe is wholly ſpent in conſolations to be oppoſed to death and temptations in death. Whoſoever therefore deſires to receive this oil of conſolation, let him bring the veſſel of a contrite heart: for what doth comfort belong to him, that is not yet contrite and made ſad?</p>
            <p>And I have dedicated this Manual unto you, moſt dear friends and reverend bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in Chriſt, to give a publick teſtimony of that near friendſhip and brotherhood we are linked together in. And you your ſelves alſo carry about you a body ſubject to diſeaſes, and there cannot but daily ariſe in your minds the remembrance of death: I do not at all therefore doubt, although your faith needeth not theſe props, which for my own and others uſe I have collected in
<pb facs="tcp:41602:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>this little book; but that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the reading of it will not be unpleaſant to you, epecially ſeeing it comes from a friendly and candid mind. I pray our Lord Jeſus will every where bleſs us and the labours of our miniſtry by his grace and ſpirit.</p>

                        <p>Outwardly indeed the promiſe is offer'd to all, but God from eternity hath made a certain abſolute decree of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of particular men, whom from an abſolute hatred being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by him he hath deſtin'd to eternal torments: To theſe he offers his word indeed outwardly, but not with an intent to beſtow the good things offer'd in the word.

                        <p>That abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of reprobation is but the fancy of men who are deceived, and do deceive. For if the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture do witneſs by words, Chriſt by tears, and God by oath that he is not willing that any ſhould periſh, that he deſireth not the death of a ſinner; but on the contrary heartily deſireth that all would come to repentance, would
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41602:23"/>acknowledge the truth and be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; with what ſhew of truth, I pray, can it be ſaid that any by the abſolute hatred of God are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from ſalvation and the means thereof? Such as God hath declared himſelf outwardly in his word, ſuch is his heart inwardly (if I may ſo ſpeak.) Such as he hath ſhewn himſelf to us in his ſon, ſuch a mind alſo he beareth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us; for Chriſt is the <hi>image of the Father,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Col. 1.15. Heb. 1.3.</note> not only in reſpect of his eſſence, but alſo of his will. Indeed we ought not ſo much as think, that he ſhews himſelf to us a bountiful and gracious God out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and in the mean time does nouriſh flames of hatred inwardly; this be far from God who is truth it ſelf, to whom all hypocriſie is extremely hateful, who ought in no wiſe to be ſaid to do that, which we ſee him forbid by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and avenge by puniſhments. That any are ſaved, is the gift of God only; that many periſh, is the deſert of themſelves that do periſh. For ſo ſaith the Scripture.

A ſpark may lie hid rak'd up under the aſhes, although it appear not outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: ſo faith ſometimes dwells in the inmoſt receſſes of the heart, though it be not perceived of our ſelves. Wherefore though thou perceiveſt no faith, gather not preſently from thence that all thy faith is periſhed and dead, ſeeing thou yet deſireſt, longeſt and art willing to believe: that deſire, that longing, that willing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from faith.

By good works is underſtood chiefly the inward renewing of the heart; and the kindling of thoſe ſpiritual motions in the hearts of thoſe that

All things grow vile, are whiſht and ſtand amaz'd: there is every where a vacation, a reſt of things.

The Moon is renewed, which a monthly number had conſumed. Winters and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, ſprings and autumns are hurled round, with their vertues, manners, fruits. For earth has been taught by heaven, to cloath the trees after their nakedneſs, to colour the flowers afreſh, to put forth graſs again, to give the ſame ſeeds that were ſpent: and not to give them till they are firſt ſpent. An admirable way! to become a preſerver from a deſtroyer: it takes away, that it may reſtore: it loſes, that it may keep: it corrupts, that it may keep entire: that it may encreaſe, it ſpends.

                  <p>UPright <hi>Adam</hi> was made Immortal, but ſinful <hi>Adam</hi> begot all his ſons mortal, even as he had made himſelf; <hi>Adam</hi> therefore is dead, and all the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> do but live to die; the ſentence of death paſt upon us all in him, &amp; we
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:41602:91"/>are born to ſee this ſentence execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon our ſelves: and as <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf dyed the ſame day he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that is, brought himſelf into a neceſſity of dying, though as to the time of his death, he was reprieved for nine hundred and thirty years after that day; So we in <hi>Adam</hi> came under the ſame neceſſity, though it be ſome thouſands of years after, before the ſentence be executed upon us. As a Malefactor is a dead man in Law at that inſtant when the ſentence is pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, though his execution be reſpited for ſome few days after; So according to Gods law and decree, we are all dead in <hi>Adams</hi> doom, though it pleaſe God to prolong theſe days of ours, wherein we muſt live to die according to his irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable doom. A Malefactor is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted ſometimes one, two, three, four, five or ſix days after judgment paſt: ſo likewiſe we were all adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to die before we were born, but God (with whom a thouſand years is but as one day) hath appointed the firſt, ſecond, third, fourth, fifth,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:41602:91"/>or ſixth thouſand year of the world to be the day of our execution.</p>
                  <p>There is more neceſſity of our dying than of our being born. It is not ſo neceſſary that he who is not, ſhould be, as that he that now lives, ſhould once die; the former may be ſuppoſed, but the latter is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed; <hi>It is appointed for all men once to dye,</hi> Heb. 9.27. There is alwayes a greater neceſſity of the end than the means; death is the end of life, not only in the execution of it, but in the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Morti nati ſumus,</hi> we are born to dye, and we dye from the time we are born; The day of our birth what is it, but the beginning of the day of our death? and the day of our death but the end of our birth-day? our birth-day precedes the day of our death, but the day of our death is preferr'd before that of our birth by the wiſe <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccl. 7.3. <hi>The day of death is better than the day one is born.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And did we rightly conſider this, our birthday is indeed a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, and the day of our death
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:41602:92"/>in compariſon thereof, a reward; for death only is the remedy againſt the miſeries of life, and to dye is but to reſt from thoſe labours, and to be free from thoſe ſorrows where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we are born. What a plague and puniſhment were the day of our birth into a ſinful miſerable world, did not the day of our death give an end to all ſuch evils both of ſin, ſorrows and pains?</p>
                  <p>Now ſince (as I have ſaid) our birth-day is but the beginning of our death, and the day of our death but the end of our birth-day; we ſeem to ſpeak improperly, to call the day of our departure on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the day of our death. On our laſt day indeed we ceaſe to live, but from our firſt day we begin to dye; our laſt day is not the cauſe of our death, but the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it, it doth rather finiſh than begin our death: it is not the laſt and utmoſt minute of our life, which brings death upon us, it doth rather manifeſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that death was always with us. As the Prophet ſpeaking of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:41602:92"/>perſecution ſays, <hi>we are killed all the day long,</hi> Pſal. 44.22. and the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> concerning his own ſufferings, <hi>I dye daily,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.31.</p>
                  <p>So that though no violence or injury were offered to us, yet even through natures frailty <hi>we dye dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and by fatal Mortality <hi>are killed all the day long;</hi> we dye daily from the time we firſt begin to live; the firſt day of our life is our long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt day, and every day afterward takes away one day from our lives; and the longer we have lived, the leſs time we have to live: <hi>Quotidie morimur,</hi> &amp;c. ſayes <hi>Seneca, we dye daily, and every day takes away part of our life, and while we are yet growing up, our life decreaſes; the very day that we now live, we do divide it with death.</hi> As by the time we ſpend in eating, ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, working and playing, ſo by the moments which paſs away in reading, ſpeaking, writing, our lives are ſhortened.</p>
                  <p>We dye daily, our times dye daily, our actions dye daily, our Perſons dye daily, our times dye

Our perſons dye daily, our infancy dies to our childhood, our child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to our youth, our youth to our manhood, our manhood to our old Age, and our old Age dies into our death.</p>
                  <p>A man is in a continual Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of himſelf, his days waſte him as well as he ſpends his days, one part or other of him languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, periſheth or corrupts every day, <hi>we dye by piece-meal not all at once,</hi> ſaith <hi>Seneca.</hi> There is not one day but wherein our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:41602:93"/>do in ſome meaſure waſte, our blood cools, our moiſture dries, our ſtomach fails, our liver corrupts, our Lungs conſume, our bowels yearn, our hearts faint, or our head akes. Every day either ſome vein ſtops, ſome ſinew ſhrinks, ſome bone breaks, ſome skin is withered, ſome fleſh bruiſed, or at leaſt ſome parts or member decayed. The eyes grow dimmer of ſight, the ears more dull of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or the palate more unſavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of taſting every day than other. Thus the ſeveral parts dye by little and little, and thus at laſt the whole becomes dead. As the Candle conſumes from the time it firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to burn, ſo doth the Oyl and marrow of mans life waſte from the very time he begins to live. Man is like a candle, that either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes himſelf in the Candleſtick of this world, or elſe he is ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered under the Buſhel of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Womb. An hour-glaſs runs conſtantly from the very time it is turned up; man is like this hour glaſs, he is but running ſand,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:41602:94"/>or moving duſt; and as the ſand in the hour-glaſs falls by degrees one ſand after another till the whole be run out, ſo a man drops away by little and little till the whole is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed. A traveller goes forward many days towards his journeys end; man is a Traveller, his life is the way he goes and death is the end of his journey: and is it then a ſtrange thing for us to dye, when our whole life is but the way and path that leads to death? <hi>Do we think we ſhall never arrive to that which we are continually going toward,</hi> ſayes <hi>Seneca.</hi> There is no way on earth to which there is not an end, the moſt intricate Labyrinth hath a way out of it at laſt. We are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually walking towards death, how can we then chuſe but meet with it at laſt? we dye daily; how can it then be avoided but at laſt we muſt come to be dead? <hi>Wretched man then that thou art, why doſt thou not daily diſpoſe and prepare thy ſelf for death ſince thou dieſt dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> ſayes <hi>St. Bernard.</hi> Imagine thy ſelf to be dead, ſince thou muſt
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:41602:94"/>of neceſſity dye. Wo unto us wretched creatures that all of us are ſo near death, and yet moſt of us put this day ſo far from us. Death is ready to take us by the hand in the natural execution of its office, before we are willing to take it to heart by our Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Meditation. We go toward the grave with our faces turned back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſo that our feet are juſt ready to fall into the pit, before our eyes do once look upon it. There are many who feel death, before they know what it is, and do wofully hazard and experience it, before they could be perſwaded ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wiſely to conſider or conceive thereof; for though we daily ſee death ſeizing upon others, yet we can hardly be perſwaded to believe our ſelves concerned: as a learned Author ſays, <hi>men behold nothing more familiarly than death, and yet they forget and neglect nothing more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Death then is a mighty King, the great Conquerour of mankind, to whom all the Glorys of this world muſt ſubmit, and yet our
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:41602:95"/>bleſſed Apoſtle exultingly cryes out, <hi>Oh death where is thy ſting?</hi> Let us then conſider St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Appellation, or his ſummons to death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oh death, what art thou?</hi> a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera, a fable, a bugbear, a dream, a ſhadow, a nothing. Oh death thou art none of Gods creature; the Wiſe man ſaith, <hi>God made not death, neither hath he pleaſure in deſtruction,</hi> Wiſd. 1.13. God is the God of our life and being, and he delights not in our deſtruction; death was never intended againſt us, but againſt our ſin: we were therefore made mortal, that our ſins might not be immortal; we muſt dye once, that ſin may not always live.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oh death, what doſt thou?</hi> Thou diſſolveſt the rareſt compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heaven and earth, thou divideſt our ſpirits from our clay, thou doſt ſeparate ſoul and body; ſharper art thou than any two-edged ſword, and entreſt to the dividing aſunder the ſoul and ſpirit, yea thou divideſt between
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:41602:95"/>the marrow and the bone, <hi>Thou makeſt our duſt return to the earth, and our Spirit to God that gave it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oh death,</hi> Thou makeſt our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to vaniſh, our breath to ſtop, our blood to cool, our colour to change, our beauty to fade, and our ſtrength to fail: thou (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.2.) <hi>makeſt the keepers of the houſe</hi> (our hands) <hi>to tremble, and the ſtrong men</hi> (our feet <hi>to bow themſelves; thou makeſt the grinders</hi> (our Teeth) <hi>to ceaſe, and them that look out at the windows</hi> (our eyes) <hi>to wax dim;</hi> thou <hi>ſhutteſt the dores</hi> of our lips and ſtoppeſt our windpipes, <hi>the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Muſick.</hi> Thou cutteſt ſhort <hi>the ſilver Cord</hi> of our Marrow, and breakeſt the <hi>golden bowl</hi> of our brain pan, thou <hi>breakeſt the pitcher</hi> of our veins at <hi>the fountain</hi> of our liver; at the <hi>ciſtorn</hi> of our heart there break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou the <hi>wheel</hi> of our head.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oh death,</hi> Thou art ordained for us all; <hi>It is appointed for all men once to die;</hi> we muſt all walk in this way, all-tread this ſame path, we muſt all ſleep the ſame ſleep our laſt ſleep, and the dark night
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:41602:96"/>of death will at laſt overtake us all; <hi>our fathers are dead</hi> (ſaith the Father) <hi>our friends are dead, and we our ſelves muſt die alſo.</hi> Some are gone before us, ſome do accompany us, and ſome will come after us; as wave after wave daſhes againſt the Rock, ſo ſhall we all one after another daſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this hard and cold Rock of death. And thus ſooner or later we all muſt die at laſt. We are born with that condition, that we muſt die: we do therefore put on the Garment of our body that we may again put it off. Death is the Law of Nature, and to dye is but to pay a Tribute due to Nature; it is as natural for us to live, and then to die, as it is for us to wake and ſleep.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oh death,</hi> Thou wilt certainly come, yet it is moſt uncertain when; nothing is more certain than death, but than the hour of death there is nothing more uncertain, <hi>of that day and hour knoweth no man,</hi> Matt. 24.36. that is, of the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the <hi>hour</hi> of death: Death comes as <hi>a thief in the night,</hi> both certainly, ſuddenly, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:41602:96"/>it takes one <hi>upon the houſe top,</hi> another <hi>in the field,</hi> one work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>in the Vineyard,</hi> another <hi>grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Mill;</hi> one upon <hi>the houſe top</hi> of honours, another <hi>in the field of pleaſures;</hi> one labouring <hi>in the Vineyard</hi> of a Chriſtian calling, another <hi>grinding at the Mill</hi> of worldly cares and troubles, <hi>a man knoweth not his time,</hi> Eccl. 9.12. that is, the time of his death. God will not diſcover to us the time when death ſhall come upon us, becauſe he would have us think it to be ever near us; he will not let us know our laſt day, becauſe he would have us imagine and expect every day to be our laſt. <hi>This one hour the hour of death is hidden from us, that all the hours of our life might be the better improved by us,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oh Death,</hi> Thou art impartial, and indifferent to all, thou calleſt equally and as ſoon at the gate of the Palace, as at the door of the Cottage; thou makeſt the skull of the King and begger alike, and between the duſt of either thou
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:41602:97"/>knoweſt no difference; thou haſt neither pity upon the poor, nor reſpect unto the rich; thou neither ſcorneſt the fooliſh, nor doſt thou reverence the wiſe, <hi>How dieth the wiſe man</hi> (ſays <hi>Solomon) even as the fool,</hi> Eccl. 2.16. Thou doſt long threaten the old man, and ſoon betrayeſt, and ſruprizeſt the young; thou never ſpareſt any for their Age, Sex, degree, or wealth; we can by no power or force reſiſt thee, nor by any diligence avoid thee, no tears can move thee, no money bribe thee, no art nor Eloquence can perſwade thee.</p>
                  <p>Oh Death, Thou haſt manifold appearances, and comeſt to us in ſeveral forms and ſhapes; toward the old man thou approacheſt pale and lean, toward the young bloody and boyſterous, to the bad man thou appeareſt as black as Hell it ſelf; and terrible to every man. Thou comeſt to us ſometimes by the hands of men, ſometimes by the Teeth of beaſts; ſometimes by Fire, and ſometimes by water,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:41602:97"/>ſometimes by a cold blaſt of wind, ſometimes by the ſlipping of a foot, and ſometimes by the falling of a tyle or ſtone; ſometimes in our cloths, and ſometimes in our meat and drink: We dye ſeveral ways, and by divers means; ſome dye in War, and ſome in peace, ſome by ſea, and ſome by land, ſome in the field, and ſome in their beds, ſome by their own ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glects and intemperance, others by a ſudden wound or a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing diſeaſe: and thus by a Thouſand ways of dying, one death or other at laſt deſtroys us all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oh Death, How bitter is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of thee to a man that liveth at reſt in his poſſeſſions! Oh Death how acceptable is thy judgement to the needy,</hi> ſaith the Wiſe man, <hi>Eccluſ.</hi> 41.1, 2. Oh death, thou art indeed like a ſhadow, thou flieſt thoſe that follow thee, and followeſt thoſe that flye from thee, thou haſtneſt toward us when we deſire to avoid thee, and when we would imbrace thee, thou then
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:41602:98"/>delayeſt us. Death is the rich mans fear, &amp; the poor mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. Thou art often called upon in adverſity, ſeldom or never thought on in Proſperity. In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity we complain and cry with <hi>Hezekiah, Iſai.</hi> 38. to have further time <hi>added to our days,</hi> but in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity we are apt every one to wiſh with Elijah, <hi>It is enough now O Lord, take away my ſoul, for I am no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than my Fathers,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oh Death,</hi> How dreadful a thing art thou to fleſh and blood! how do we abhor to think that the <hi>Grave ſhould be our houſe,</hi> and that we <hi>ſhould make our bed in darkneſs,</hi> to <hi>ſay to corruption thou art my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to the worm thou art my ſiſter, and my mother.</hi> How hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is it to inherite ſerpents and worms, to be ſeparated from our ſelves, and return to our duſt! How terrible is death to us not only from our own experience, but from the example of others! as often as we ſee or hear that another is dead, we are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to think that we muſt dye alſo;
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:41602:98"/>and when we are ſick and think that death is coming upon our ſelves, how are we troubled! not well knowing what we ſhall do, or whither we muſt go: we are afraid to dye, even we, who have good hope of a better life after death; we who look for an houſe not made with hands, are not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding unwilling to leave this houſe of clay; we who have the promiſe of a kingdom, are yet unwilling to forſake our priſon, we are afraid to <hi>be diſſolved</hi> though we deſire to be with Chriſt; we dread the paſſage, though we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce to approach to our home and habitation in the Heavens.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding what hath been ſaid, yet let us encourage our ſelves againſt the fear of death, and by the example, and in the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> let us ask, <hi>Oh Death where is thy ſting?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For death truly conſidered is but a ſhadow, a meer bugbear, which children only ought to fear; death is nothing, and we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of we know not what;
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:41602:99"/>death only ſeparates between ſoul and body, why do we fear that it ſhould thus diſſolve us, and not rather rejoyce that it cannot deſtroy us? Let us not fear what may ſeparate us from our ſelves, but let us rather imbrace what will convey us to our Chriſt, and our God. Death is appointed for us all, why then are we afraid of what we cannot poſſibly avoid? Our willingneſs to dye is the only means to take away the terribleneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. <hi>Let us therefore offer our lives to God freely which he will otherwiſe require from us as a due debt,</hi> ſays <hi>Chryſoſtom.</hi> The coming of death is uncertain, and ſhall any thing that is uncertain cauſe in us a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fear? But rather <hi>ſince it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, at what time or in what place death will overtake us, let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at all times, and in all places ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and look for it,</hi> ſays <hi>Seneca.</hi> Beſides, death deals equally and impartially to all, and this alſo ſhould make us leſs afraid of it: <hi>Who can reaſonably complain</hi> (ſays <hi>Seneca) that he is in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:41602:99"/>wherein all men elſe are?</hi> Who can expect that death ſhould ſpare any, ſince it is indiſpenſible to all? when there is a general ruin threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to the whole world, who can think himſelf alone ſhould eſcape? The equality of death is ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort againſt the cruelty thereof; there are ſeveral ways of dying, and why ſhould that make us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of death? 'tis no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which way we dye, ſince we can be but dead at laſt; <hi>ſince we muſt dye, let us not much regard by what means, but let us take care whither we muſt go after death,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude, death is a thing that is indeed fearful to fleſh and blood, and yet all this ſhould not make us afraid of death; for it is not death it ſelf, but the fear of it, that is ſo terrible; and this alſo proceeds more from our ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance than from the thing it ſelf, <hi>did we but know death, we would not ſo much fear it,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Chryſoſtome.</hi> The fear of death is the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ignorance, and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:41602:100"/>which makes us apprehend things to be new and ſtrange, which really are not ſo. The only way therefore to free us from the fear of death, is by daily meditation thereof to make it familiar to us, to acquaint our ſelves with it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it comes, that we may the leſs dread its appearance. Thus ſhall we find that by learning not to fear death, we ſhall at laſt come like our bleſſed Apoſtle to triumph over it, and to ſay, <hi>O death where is thy ſting?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Death is not yet deſtroyed, for St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, the laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed is death, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.26. But yet it is diſarmed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, <hi>Oh death where is thy ſting?</hi> This ſeems to be an <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Captains ſong of victory, and the Souldiers ſong of deliverance; they look like the words of a mighty conqueror bravely triumphing over a baſe and wretched enemy; and who is this conqueror but Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the Lord of <hi>Life?</hi> it was he who ſpoke the words in the Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> 13.14. <hi>O death I will be thy
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:41602:100"/>death.</hi> And it is in the power of Chriſt that the Apoſtle ſpeaks thus, <hi>O death where is thy ſting?</hi> Jeſus Chriſt did once ſubdue death for us, and ſaid, <hi>O death I will be thy death,</hi> and we may now tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over death in the ſtrength of Chriſt, and ſay with our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>O death where is thy ſting?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Jeſus Chriſt overcame death by dying; nay more, by death he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed not death only, but <hi>him alſo who had power over death,</hi> the Devil, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.14. Our captain hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered our enemy at his own wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, he hath caught this Mighty Hunter in his own ſnare, he yielded only to death to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage againſt death, yea there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laid he down his life that death might no longer live: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (ſays St. <hi>Chryſoſtom) we do not believe that Chriſt is dead in death, but we believe that death is dead in Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Death that greedy whale durſt venture to devour Chriſt Jeſus, our <hi>Jonas</hi> (who was caſt into the ſea of the world, that the ſtorms
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:41602:101"/>and Tempeſts of the Devil and ſin might ceaſe) but yet he was preſerved alive in the fiſhes belly, in <hi>the belly of Hell,</hi> in the jaws of death, that he might preach repentance to the <hi>Ninive</hi> of the Church. This great whale Death ſwallowed the bait of Chriſts humanity, but the hook of his Divinity intangled her, and made her vomit up her bowels bait and all. Death deſigned to have ſwallowed Chriſt and left him in darkneſs and obſcurity, but death it ſelf <hi>was ſwallowed up in victory.</hi> The ſerpent death was bold to ſting our Saviour, but he made him loſe his ſting for his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, ſo that in his name we may now chearfully ask, <hi>Oh Death where is thy ſting? The ſting of death is ſin,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.56. <hi>Chriſt the Lamb of God hath taken away the ſins of the world,</hi> John 1.29. In Chriſt Jeſus therefore we may joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſay, <hi>Oh death where is thy ſting?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> asketh this queſtion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning man, <hi>Man dieth, and where is he? Job</hi> 14.10. but we may ask the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:41602:101"/>ſame queſtion of Death, <hi>man dieth, and where is death?</hi> yea we ask the ſame of the worſt part of death, which is its ſting, Oh death where is thy ſting?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jacob</hi> bewailed the death of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſaying <hi>Joſeph is dead, Joſeph is not,</hi> Gen. 42. and <hi>Rachel</hi> wept <hi>for her children,</hi> and <hi>would not be comforted becauſe they were not,</hi> Mat. 2. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe death had ſeized upon them, they thought their children to be quite gone.</p>
                  <p>But to ſpeak properly, death does only convey us where we ought to be, but death it ſelf is indeed no where, <hi>O death where is thy ſting?</hi> Death is utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the Croſs of Chriſt. When death firſt entered into the world it was like the <hi>waters of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah exceeding bitter,</hi> Exo. 15. but ſince the Tree of the Croſs of Chriſt, it is now made ſweet and pleaſant to us: we might once have cryed out with the children of the Prophets, <hi>Death is in the pot, death is in the pot,</hi> 2 Kings 4. but ſince our bleſſed Saviour hath
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:41602:102"/>declared, <hi>This Cup is the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my blood,</hi> we may now ſay with the bleſſed Saints of God, <hi>This is the Cup of Salvation,</hi> Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in the cup, death is now no more, ſince the Lord of life deſtroyed death, his death hath quickened our life, and hath ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and taken away the ſting of death from us.</p>
                  <p>Our Apoſtle does not ask, <hi>Oh death</hi> what <hi>is thy ſting?</hi> though the words which follow ſeem to be an anſwer to ſuch a queſtion, <hi>the ſting of death is ſin:</hi> it ſeems then that death is not the ſting of ſin, but ſin is the ſting of death, for (ſays <hi>Anſelm</hi>) we <hi>do indeed dye for ſinning, but we do not ſin for dying.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as thoſe words following anſwer to a Queſtion which they ask not, ſo the former words ask a queſtion, to which thoſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing anſwer not, <hi>Oh death where is thy ſting?</hi> Now not to tell you where it is, is as much as to ſay, it is no where; death hath now no ſting, let us all rejoyce and be glad,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:41602:102"/>this ſerpent may hiſs at us, this waſp may buz about us, but it can now neither bite not ſting us: the ſting of death is gone, and nothing remains but the name, nay the name too is gone to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus; the death of the godly man is not to be called a death, but a ſleep, a reſting from their labours, a delivery out of priſon, a laying down their burden, a flying to their deſired home; death now hath loſt her <hi>ſting,</hi> it is not now a puniſhment, but a happy paſſage, not ſo much an end of this life, as an entrance into a better, not a deſtruction but a diſſolution, only a ſeparation of the ſoul and body for a ſhort time, that ſo they might be joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to enjoy heaven and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with Chriſt our Lord, and life to all eternity.</p>
                  <p>Thus have we asked this one queſtion of death, <hi>Oh death where is thy ſting?</hi> now let us ask ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our ſelves, why are we ſo deſperately and deſpairingly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of death, ſince we have heard
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:41602:103"/>and do certainly know that death hath loſt her ſting? Oh faithleſs and faint-hearted man! why doſt thou tremble (O Chriſtian) to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with thy laſt enemy, ſince its weapon is now taken from it? why doſt thou ſhrink at the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſerpent, when thou knoweſt her poyſon and ſting are quite taken away? Oh faithleſs and faint-hearted ſoul, to be ſo afraid of a ſhadow! Alas why do we ſo dreadfully fear death, ſince our ſouls are not loſt but ſent before; it is for thoſe only to tremble at death, that paſs from one death to another, from the death of the body on earth, to the death of the body and ſoul in hell for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; it is for thoſe only to fear a temporal death ſo terribly, who are either ignorant or do deſpair of eternal life, who go from their Priſon in this world, to the place of their execution world without end.</p>
                  <p>But as for thoſe that are in Chriſt Jeſus, they paſs from a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to a Palace, from a dungeon
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:41602:103"/>to a Throne, from a crazy and miſerable Tabernacle here, to an eternal habitation in the heavens. <hi>It is for them</hi> (ſays <hi>Cyprian</hi>) <hi>to fear to be diſſolved who have no hope to be with Chriſt.</hi> A deſpairing fear of death, is but a deſpair of eternal life after death; Men na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally chuſe rather to ſuffer a great deal of pain and live, than to endure a ſmall pain in dying, which demonſtrates, that it is ſomething after death (and not death it ſelf) which we ſo much dread.

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:41602:104"/>of glory?</hi> having <hi>run our race,</hi> why ſeem we ſo unwilling to <hi>receive the prize?</hi> let us not fear the threats of a <hi>Temporal death,</hi> but rather let us rejoyce in the promiſes of <hi>eternal life: For whether we live we live unto the Lord, and whether we dye, we dye unto the Lord, therefore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we live or dye we are the Lords.</hi> Let not our lives be ſo wicked and prophane, as that we ſhould be therefore aſhamed to live, neither let us be ſo negligent and ignorant of death, as to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore afraid to dye. But at the inſtant of our departure, let us every one ſay, (as that dying Saint did which <hi>Hierom</hi> mentions) <hi>go forth my ſoul, go forth, what doſt thou fear?</hi> Let every ſoul of us learn to ſay ſincerely and chearfully at his laſt paſſage from his earthly Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What though I dye, I know that my Redeemer liveth; though my body be diſſolved, yet ſhall my Spirit be conjoyned with Chriſt my Saviour. Lye down then O my body and return unto thy duſt; mount aloft O my ſoul,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:41602:104"/>and meet thy Saviour in the Air: my body ſhall be earth and worms meat for a ſhort time, but my ſoul I am aſſured ſhall be a companion with Saints and Angels for ever and ever.</hi>
